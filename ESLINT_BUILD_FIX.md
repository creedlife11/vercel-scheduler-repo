# 🔧 ESLint Build Error - FIXED

## ❌ **Build Error:**
```
./pages/api/generate.ts
83:11  Error: 'working' is never reassigned. Use 'const' instead.  prefer-const
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
ESLint couldn't detect that the `working` variable was being modified later in the code with `working.push(...selected)` due to the way the array mutation was written.

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**
Changed from implicit array mutation to explicit reassignment:

### **Before (ESLint Error):**
```typescript
let working = expectedWorking.filter(eng => !onLeaveToday.includes(eng));
// Later...
working.push(...selected); // ESLint couldn't detect this mutation
```

### **After (ESLint Compliant):**
```typescript
const initialWorking = expectedWorking.filter(eng => !onLeaveToday.includes(eng));
let working = [...initialWorking]; // Explicitly mutable array
// Later...
working = [...working, ...selected]; // Explicit reassignment
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Status:**
- **Commit:** `ff2a279` - "Fix ESLint error in generate.ts"
- **Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED**
- **Build:** Should now pass ESLint validation
- **Features:** All enhanced backfill integration features preserved

## 🧪 **Verification:**
The enhanced backfill integration should now deploy successfully to Vercel without build errors.

**Test URL:** https://vercel-scheduler-repo.vercel.app/
