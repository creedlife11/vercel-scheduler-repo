# Task 2.1: Core Regression Test Suite - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully completed Task 2.1 "Create core regression test suite" with comprehensive invariant checking for the scheduler. The test suite ensures data integrity and prevents regressions in core scheduling functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Test File: `test_schedule_invariants.py`
Complete pytest-based test suite with the following test categories:

#### 1. CSV Column Count Consistency ✅
- **`test_csv_column_count_consistency`**: Asserts every CSV row has exact expected column count
- Parses CSV output properly using Python's csv module
- Validates header consistency across all data rows
- Prevents malformed CSV exports that could break downstream processing

#### 2. Status Field Validation ✅
- **`test_status_field_validation`**: Ensures status fields only contain valid values
- Validates only WORK/OFF/LEAVE/empty values in status columns
- Identifies status columns correctly (odd indices in CSV structure)
- Prevents engineer names or other data from appearing in status fields

#### 3. Engineer Field Integrity ✅
- **`test_engineer_field_integrity`**: Validates engineer columns contain only valid names
- Checks engineer columns (even indices) for valid engineer names only
- Uses regex patterns to detect time strings that shouldn't appear in engineer columns
- Prevents time formats (HH:MM, 12am/pm, shift words) in engineer fields

#### 4. Weekend Coverage Patterns ✅
- **`test_weekend_coverage_patterns`**: Validates Week A/B alternation logic
- Ensures weekend assignments rotate among multiple engineers
- Verifies fair distribution of weekend coverage over multiple weeks
- Prevents single engineer from being assigned all weekends

#### 5. Leave Handling Conflicts ✅
- **`test_leave_handling_conflicts`**: Tests leave exclusion logic
- Verifies engineers on leave are not assigned on their leave days
- Tests conflict resolution when engineers are unavailable
- Ensures proper backfill behavior

#### 6. Scheduling Invariants ✅
- **`test_no_oncall_on_weekends_invariant`**: Critical business rule validation
- Asserts oncall assignments never occur on weekends (Saturday/Sunday)
- Validates weekend status is properly set to OFF (or LEAVE)
- Prevents violation of core scheduling constraints

#### 7. Backward Compatibility ✅
- **`test_backward_compatibility`**: Ensures original API still works
- Tests that `make_schedule()` function continues to work
- Validates original return format (list of dictionaries)
- Ensures enhanced features don't break existing functionality

#### 8. Enhanced Schedule Structure ✅
- **`test_enhanced_schedule_structure`**: Validates new ScheduleResult format
- Tests complete ScheduleResult dataclass structure
- Validates metadata, fairness_report, and decision_log components
- Ensures schema version 2.0 is properly set

## Test Fixtures and Utilities

### Standard Test Fixtures
- **`basic_engineers`**: 6-engineer test fixture for standard scenarios
- **`basic_seeds`**: Standard seed configuration for reproducible tests
- **`empty_leave`**: Empty leave DataFrame for baseline testing
- **`sample_leave`**: Sample leave data for conflict testing

### Test Coverage Areas
- ✅ CSV export format integrity
- ✅ Status field validation (WORK/OFF/LEAVE only)
- ✅ Engineer field integrity (no time strings)
- ✅ Weekend coverage rotation patterns
- ✅ Leave conflict handling
- ✅ Core scheduling invariants (no oncall on weekends)
- ✅ Backward compatibility with original API
- ✅ Enhanced schedule structure validation

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 2.1: CSV Column Integrity ✅
- Every CSV row has exact expected column count
- Proper CSV parsing and validation
- Header consistency verification

### Requirement 2.2: Status Field Validation ✅
- Only WORK/OFF/LEAVE values in status columns
- Prevents data corruption in status fields
- Validates proper column identification

### Requirement 2.3: Engineer Field Integrity ✅
- Only valid engineer names in engineer columns
- No time strings or invalid data in engineer fields
- Regex-based pattern detection for time formats

## Key Features Implemented

### Comprehensive Invariant Checking
- ✅ Column count consistency across all CSV rows
- ✅ Status field value validation (WORK/OFF/LEAVE only)
- ✅ Engineer field integrity (no time strings)
- ✅ Weekend oncall prohibition (core business rule)
- ✅ Leave conflict resolution validation

### Robust Test Infrastructure
- ✅ Pytest-based test framework
- ✅ Comprehensive test fixtures for various scenarios
- ✅ Proper CSV parsing and validation
- ✅ Regex-based pattern detection for data integrity

### Backward Compatibility Testing
- ✅ Original `make_schedule()` function testing
- ✅ Enhanced `make_enhanced_schedule()` function testing
- ✅ ScheduleResult structure validation
- ✅ Schema versioning verification

## Integration with Task 1
This test suite validates all the components implemented in Task 1:
- Tests enhanced data models (ScheduleResult, FairnessReport, etc.)
- Validates ExportManager CSV output format
- Verifies schema versioning (v2.0)
- Tests enhanced schedule generation function

## Next Steps
This test suite provides the foundation for:
- Task 2.2: Build comprehensive edge case test coverage
- Task 2.3: Set up dual-lane CI/CD pipeline
- Continuous integration with 90% coverage requirements
- Automated regression testing for all future changes

The comprehensive test suite ensures data integrity and prevents regressions while supporting the enhanced scheduling features implemented in Task 1.
