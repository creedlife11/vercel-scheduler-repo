# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing team scheduler application with improved business logic for weekend shifts, on-call rotations, daily role assignments, and leave management. The focus is on building upon the current implementation to add proper scheduling rules while maintaining fairness tracking and data integrity. The current system already has basic rotation and infrastructure - these requirements define the next level of sophistication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Weekend Shift Logic

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want weekend workers to have consistent patterns with proper compensation days so that weekend coverage is fair and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an engineer works weekend THEN they SHALL work consecutive Saturday and Sunday shifts
2. WHEN working weekend THEN engineer SHALL get compensatory time off during the week
3. WHEN assigning weekend shifts THEN the system SHALL rotate fairly among all engineers using existing rotation logic
4. WHEN displaying schedules THEN weekend patterns SHALL be clearly marked and distinguishable
5. WHEN calculating fairness THEN weekend work SHALL be weighted appropriately in workload calculations

### Requirement 2: Improved On-Call Assignment Rules

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want on-call engineers to have clear weekday assignments with smart conflict avoidance so that workload is properly distributed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an engineer works on-call THEN they SHALL work Monday through Friday weekdays only
2. WHEN assigning on-call THEN the system SHALL avoid assigning weekend workers when possible
3. WHEN assigning on-call THEN the system SHALL use existing rotation logic with conflict avoidance
4. WHEN scheduling conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL log decisions and provide alternatives
5. WHEN tracking fairness THEN on-call assignments SHALL be counted in workload calculations

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Early Shift Assignment

**User Story:** As a scheduler, I want exactly two engineers on early shift each weekday with the on-call engineer always included so that morning coverage is adequate and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning early shifts THEN exactly two engineers SHALL work early each weekday
2. WHEN selecting early shift workers THEN the weekday on-call engineer SHALL always be one of the two
3. WHEN choosing the second early worker THEN system SHALL select from remaining available engineers fairly
4. WHEN tracking assignments THEN early shift work SHALL be counted in fairness calculations
5. WHEN displaying schedules THEN early shift times SHALL be clearly indicated (06:45-15:45)

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Daily Role Rotation

**User Story:** As a team coordinator, I want chat and appointments roles to rotate daily with improved logic so that distribution is fair and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning chat role THEN it SHALL rotate daily between engineers during weekdays (Mon-Fri)
2. WHEN assigning appointments role THEN it SHALL rotate daily between engineers during weekdays (Mon-Fri)
3. WHEN rotating roles THEN system SHALL build upon existing rotation seeds and logic
4. WHEN engineer is unavailable THEN system SHALL skip to next available engineer in rotation
5. WHEN tracking assignments THEN daily role assignments SHALL be counted in enhanced fairness metrics

### Requirement 5: Improved Schedule Display and Role Clarity

**User Story:** As a team member, I want clear role assignments and schedule display so that everyone knows their responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying schedules THEN all role assignments SHALL be clearly visible
2. WHEN showing engineer status THEN WORK/OFF/LEAVE status SHALL be accurate
3. WHEN displaying shifts THEN shift times SHALL be clearly indicated (06:45-15:45 vs 08:00-17:00)
4. WHEN tracking workload THEN all assignments SHALL be included in fairness calculations
5. WHEN exporting schedules THEN format SHALL be consistent and readable

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Leave Management System

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want improved leave handling with smart backfill logic so that schedules adapt gracefully to absences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding leave for an engineer THEN the system SHALL automatically handle their unavailability
2. WHEN reassigning due to leave THEN the system SHALL use intelligent backfill logic
3. WHEN calculating fairness THEN leave days SHALL NOT count against an engineer's workload
4. WHEN multiple engineers are on leave THEN the system SHALL find adequate coverage or warn about insufficient staffing
5. WHEN leave creates conflicts THEN the system SHALL log decisions and provide alternative suggestions

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Fairness Tracking and Analysis

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want comprehensive fairness analysis that shows equitable work distribution so that I can ensure no engineer is consistently overloaded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating schedules THEN the system SHALL calculate detailed fairness metrics using Gini coefficient
2. WHEN calculating fairness THEN the system SHALL consider weekend work, on-call, early shifts, and daily roles
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show comprehensive fairness reports with actionable insights
4. WHEN analyzing distribution THEN the system SHALL identify engineers with high/low assignment counts
5. WHEN imbalances are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific suggestions for improvement

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Decision Logging and Transparency

**User Story:** As a scheduler user, I want detailed decision logging and transparency so that I can understand how assignments were made and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating schedules THEN the system SHALL log all assignment decisions with rationale
2. WHEN making role assignments THEN the system SHALL record alternatives considered
3. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL log conflict resolution strategies
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL provide decision logs and fairness insights
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive metadata and decision history
