# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing team scheduler application with robust testing, improved data integrity, better UX, and enterprise-grade reliability features. The focus is on making the scheduling engine bulletproof while adding valuable insights and user experience improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Integrity and Export Reliability

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want guaranteed data consistency across all export formats so that I can trust the scheduling output regardless of format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating any schedule export THEN the system SHALL ensure every CSV row has the exact expected column count
2. WHEN exporting data THEN all Status fields SHALL only contain values from {WORK, OFF, LEAVE, ""} and never engineer names
3. WHEN listing engineers THEN Engineer columns (2-6) SHALL always contain known engineer names and never time strings
4. WHEN generating exports THEN the system SHALL create CSV/XLSX from a single JSON source of truth
5. WHEN writing CSV THEN the system SHALL use explicit headers, quote values per RFC 4180, and include UTF-8 BOM
6. WHEN encountering special characters THEN the system SHALL automatically escape commas/parentheses in labels
7. WHEN generating any export THEN the system SHALL include a schemaVersion for compatibility tracking

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive regression tests so that scheduling bugs cannot reoccur and data integrity is guaranteed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL assert exact CSV column counts for every generated row
2. WHEN validating status fields THEN tests SHALL verify no engineer names appear in status columns
3. WHEN checking engineer assignments THEN tests SHALL confirm all engineer columns contain valid names
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL validate leave handling, weekend patterns, and role assignments
5. WHEN running CI/CD THEN both Node.js and Python test suites SHALL pass before deployment
6. WHEN measuring coverage THEN the scheduling core SHALL maintain â‰¥90% test coverage

### Requirement 3: Dual Validation System

**User Story:** As a user, I want input validation in both UI and API so that I get immediate feedback and the system remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering data in UI THEN the system SHALL validate using Zod schemas with immediate feedback
2. WHEN receiving API requests THEN the system SHALL validate using Pydantic or equivalent Python validation
3. WHEN validating engineers THEN the system SHALL enforce unique names and proper formatting
4. WHEN selecting dates THEN the system SHALL ensure Sunday starts or offer snap-to-Sunday option
5. WHEN setting parameters THEN the system SHALL enforce reasonable bounds for weeks and other inputs
6. WHEN processing names THEN the system SHALL trim whitespace, allow diacritics, and warn on case-only duplicates

### Requirement 4: Fairness Analysis and Transparency

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want visibility into scheduling fairness and decision-making so that I can ensure equitable work distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating schedules THEN the system SHALL produce a fairness report with per-engineer role counts
2. WHEN calculating fairness THEN the system SHALL show max-min deltas and equity scores
3. WHEN making scheduling decisions THEN the system SHALL log daily decision rationale
4. WHEN handling conflicts THEN the system SHALL record exclusions and backfill decisions
5. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL display fairness metrics alongside schedule data

### Requirement 5: Enhanced User Experience

**User Story:** As a scheduler user, I want intuitive tools and rich output options so that I can efficiently manage team schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating schedules THEN the system SHALL provide tabbed artifact panel with multiple format options
2. WHEN selecting dates THEN the system SHALL offer smart date picker with Sunday snapping
3. WHEN managing leave THEN the system SHALL support CSV/XLSX import with conflict preview
4. WHEN configuring rules THEN the system SHALL support preset bundles for common scenarios
5. WHEN downloading files THEN the system SHALL use descriptive filenames with date and configuration info

### Requirement 6: Reliability and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and health monitoring so that I can ensure system reliability and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL log structured data with requestId and timings
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL surface requestId in user-facing error messages
3. WHEN checking system health THEN the system SHALL provide /api/healthz and /api/readyz endpoints
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track input sizes and processing metrics
5. WHEN validating outputs THEN the system SHALL verify scheduling invariants and log violations

### Requirement 7: Security and Multi-tenancy Foundation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want proper authentication and data isolation so that team data remains secure and separated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the system THEN users SHALL authenticate via Auth.js or Clerk
2. WHEN managing permissions THEN the system SHALL support Viewer/Editor/Admin roles
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL isolate artifacts per team
4. WHEN logging information THEN the system SHALL hash engineer names for privacy
5. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL enforce body size and week limits

### Requirement 8: API Documentation and Standards

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive documentation and standardized responses so that I can integrate reliably with the scheduling system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting the API THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI specification with examples
2. WHEN handling validation errors THEN the system SHALL return structured 422 responses
3. WHEN providing examples THEN the documentation SHALL include concrete request/response samples
4. WHEN describing limitations THEN the system SHALL document known constraints and boundaries
