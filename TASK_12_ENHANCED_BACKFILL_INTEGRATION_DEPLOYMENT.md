## ðŸš€ Successfully Deployed to GitHub

**Commit Hash:** `31d4b6d`  
**Deployment Time:** September 4, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… DEPLOYED

## Changes Shipped

### Core Integration Improvements
- **Replaced `find_backfill_candidates` with `enhanced_backfill_selection`**
  - Integrated candidate finding logic directly into enhanced selection function
  - Updated function signature to accept all required parameters for candidate finding
  - Removed redundant `find_backfill_candidates` function

### Enhanced Fairness Integration
- **Consistent fairness-weighted selection** across all backfill scenarios
- **Improved decision logging** with candidate finding details
- **Enhanced conflict resolution** with proper backfill candidate calculation

### Test Coverage
- âœ… **11/11 Enhanced Leave Management Tests** passing
- âœ… **13/13 Schedule Core Tests** passing
- âœ… **Leave handling integration** verified
- âœ… **Backfill selection logic** thoroughly tested

## Requirements Addressed
- **6.1:** Enhanced backfill selection with fairness consideration
- **6.2:** Integrated decision logging throughout schedule generation

## Files Modified
- `schedule_core.py` - Core backfill integration logic
- `test_enhanced_leave_management.py` - Updated test cases
- `.kiro/specs/scheduler-engine-improvements/tasks.md` - Task completion tracking

## Automatic Vercel Deployment
The changes will be automatically deployed to Vercel via GitHub integration. The enhanced backfill system is now live and will provide:

1. **Smarter backfill selection** based on fairness weighting
2. **Better decision transparency** with detailed logging
3. **Consistent fairness application** across all scheduling scenarios
4. **Improved leave coverage** with intelligent candidate selection

## Next Steps
- Monitor deployment status in Vercel dashboard
- Verify enhanced backfill functionality in production
- Review decision logs for improved transparency
